## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Git, Go and rust in the near future.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: A project to make a better Himnary for my church.
- ğŸ¤“ Some of my interests are: Quantum computers/physics, boats/trains, singin/music.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Everything falls with the same speed, no matter its weight. The only reason
      something wouldn't fall at the same time as something else is because of friction.
